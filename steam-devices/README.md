# steam-devices

`steam-devices` package only, for Steam Input support. Use this if you are
using the Steam Flatpak and want better game controller suport and input
remapping.

If you don't want to use the Steam Flatpak and instead have Steam on the system
directly, look at the `steam-silverblue` and `steam-kinoite` sysexts.

Work in progress. Please report success (and failure) with this sysext. Thanks!
