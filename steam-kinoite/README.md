# steam-kinoite

Steam and its dependencies, from the RPM Fusion repos. This sysext also include
the `steam-devices` package.

This sysext is for Fedora Kinoite only. If you are using Fedora Silverblue, use
the `steam-kinoite` sysext instead.

If you are using the Steam Flatpak, use the `steam-devices` sysext instead.

Work in progress. Please report success (and failure) with this sysext. Thanks!
